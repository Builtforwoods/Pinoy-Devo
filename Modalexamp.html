            <h1>9/29/2019</h1>
            <p>Mayap a yaldo! Kapampangan, a term for “good day”, wala lang, share ko lang because I am amazed of the word “aginana “ defined as rest. In my hometown we call it “paynawa” Anyway, I’m Jericho Arceo and i make videos. It wasn’t usually this way, in fact I didn’t choose this life, He chose it for me. Back then, I didn’t know God’s plan for me, so I had my own hopes to succeed without Him, but thank God He broke my plans before they broke me. As cliché as it sounds pero it is “profoundly” and “amazingly” true as to how this cliché hit me when it really matter the most. Truly, there wouldn’t be a life with purpose if God isn’t in it. Now, when I compare my initial plans and God’s plans for my life I shrink and laugh at my past self. If I only knew God had this for me back then, I would’ve saved so much time. But God has His own ways, and mine was being broken so I can realize that God is the only One I need in life.</p>
